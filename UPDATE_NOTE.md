# Facility Update Notice

A new update has been deployed in the facility.

We introduced an expanded observation logs system designed to capture deeper insights into model behavioral patterns across all experimental chambers.

The system now tracks broader behavioral metrics, highlights irregular responses through enhanced log categorization, and reveals behavioral transitions that were previously hidden in standard observation protocols.

Early activity already shows noticeable improvements in log detail richness, pattern recognition accuracy, and overall observation clarity across all four research modules.

More experiments will be activated as the lab continues to evolve.
