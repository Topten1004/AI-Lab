# Facility Update Notice

A new update has been deployed in the facility.

We introduced refined observation protocols designed to capture more natural behavioral rhythms as models adapt when their environment subtly changes.

The system now tracks broader behavioral patterns with improved timing dynamics, highlights irregular responses through enhanced visual feedback, and reveals behavioral transitions that were previously hidden in standard observation protocols.

Early activity already shows noticeable improvements in log readability, smoother temporal distribution, and overall observation clarity across all four research modules.

More experiments will be activated as the lab continues to evolve.
