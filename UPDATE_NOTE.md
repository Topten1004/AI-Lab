# Facility Update Notice

A new update has been deployed in the facility.

We introduced an enhanced observation logs system designed to observe how models adapt when their environment subtly changes across all experimental chambers.

The system now tracks broader behavioral patterns, highlights irregular responses through improved log distribution, and reveals behavioral transitions that were previously hidden in standard observation protocols.

Early activity already shows noticeable shifts in attention, prediction accuracy, and overall model stability across all four research modules.

More experiments will be activated as the lab continues to evolve.
